Game goal
Lead a platoon through terrain in 3D, eliminating enemy.


Win/Lose condition
There are stages. You win a stage when stage task is completed (normally wipeout of enemy). You lose when you don't have any live soldiers. Thence you start the phase over. You have a set of recruits who are eager to replace those fallen in combat.


Rules
Soldiers have 50% chance of dying when hit with a bullet and 50% chance of getting injured (can't move but can be healed by medic and not expended if they are still alive at phase end).
Ammo is unlimited though reload is needed.
Scout, medic and driver are equipped with pistols, while heavy weaponry master is equipped with a minigun.
All soldiers can use grenades, but rockets can only be used by heavy weaponry master.
Scout is not visible to enemy unless standing next to them or shooting. Grenade throwing is considered silent.
Driver gets extra speed and maneuverability when in vehicle.


Features
The platoon has several speciality soldiers: machinegunner, heavy weaponry master, scout, medic, and driver.
You can drive vehicles and blow up enemy buildings with heavy weaponry.
You can split the platoon in many.
You have access to area map.
Game keeps the count of enemy soldiers you have destroyed vs. your fallen warriors.
